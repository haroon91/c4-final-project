# Serverless TODO

To implement this project, you need to implement a simple TODO application using AWS Lambda and Serverless framework. Search for all comments starting with the `TODO:` in the code to find the placeholders that you need to implement.

# Functionality of the application

This application will allow creating/removing/updating/fetching TODO items. Each TODO item can optionally have an attachment image. Each user only has access to TODO items that he/she has created.

# TODO items

The application should store TODO items, and each TODO item contains the following fields:

- `todoId` (string) - a unique id for an item
- `createdAt` (string) - date and time when an item was created
- `name` (string) - name of a TODO item (e.g. "Change a light bulb")
- `dueDate` (string) - date and time by which an item should be completed
- `done` (boolean) - true if an item was completed, false otherwise
- `attachmentUrl` (string) (optional) - a URL pointing to an image attached to a TODO item

You might also store an id of a user who created a TODO item.

# Frontend

The `client` folder contains a web application that can use the API that should be developed in the project.

This frontend should work with your serverless application once it is developed, you don't need to make any changes to the code. The only file that you need to edit is the `config.ts` file in the `client` folder. This file configures your client application just as it was done in the course and contains an API endpoint and Auth0 configuration:

```ts
const apiId = '...' API Gateway id
export const apiEndpoint = `https://${apiId}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev`

export const authConfig = {
  domain: '...',    // Domain from Auth0
  clientId: '...',  // Client id from an Auth0 application
  callbackUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/callback'
}
```

## Note

Please note the frontend is currently not working properly.
No changes have been applied to the provided starter code.
All the endpoints have been tested with Postman and are working correctly.

Also, I found useful @BainGames's project to validate the configuration of this app.

## Authentication

To implement authentication in your application, you would have to create an Auth0 application and copy "domain" and "client id" to the `config.ts` file in the `client` folder. We recommend using asymmetrically encrypted JWT tokens.

# Best practices

To complete this exercise, please follow the best practices from the 6th lesson of this course.

# How to run the application

## Backend

To deploy the application:

- make sure to have aws cli installed and properly configured
- you can reuse my auth0 app or change:
  - the AUTH_0_SECRET in serverless.yml with your own
  * Please note using a different auth0 app may require additional conifguration.

Then run the following commands:

```
cd backend
npm install
sls deploy -v
```

## Frontend

To run a client application first edit the `client/src/config.ts` file to set correct parameters. And then run the following commands:

```
cd client
npm install
npm run start
```

This should start a development server with the React application that will interact with the serverless TODO application.

# Postman collection

An alternative way to test your API, you can use the Postman collection that contains sample requests. You can find a Postman collection in this project. To import this collection, do the following.

Click on the import button:

![Alt text](images/import-collection-1.png?raw=true 'Image 1')

Click on the "Choose Files":

![Alt text](images/import-collection-2.png?raw=true 'Image 2')

Select a file to import:

![Alt text](images/import-collection-3.png?raw=true 'Image 3')

Right click on the imported collection to set variables for the collection:

![Alt text](images/import-collection-4.png?raw=true 'Image 4')

Provide variables for the collection (similarly to how this was done in the course):

![Alt text](images/import-collection-5.png?raw=true 'Image 5')
